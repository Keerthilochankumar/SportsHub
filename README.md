What is the SportsHub?
The Sports News and Scores Dashboard is a web application providing users with up-to-date sports news articles and live scores. It allows users to stay informed about their favourite sports, read news articles, and track live match scores, all in one place. Additionally, users can personalize their dashboard by selecting their favourite sports or teams to receive tailored news and score updates.

This unified proposal combines the ability to browse sports news and scores with the option to personalize the dashboard through account creation and customization of preferences. Users can filter news articles, search for specific articles, and view live scores, all while having the ability to personalize their dashboard according to their preferences

Personas:
To better understand the target users and their needs, let's consider two personas for the Sports News and Scores Dashboard:

Sports Enthusiast: This persona represents users who are passionate about sports and want to stay updated with the latest news and scores across various sports. They enjoy reading news articles and following live matches of their favourite sports or teams.

Casual User: This persona represents users with a general interest in sports, but may not be as dedicated as sports enthusiasts. They want to access sports news and scores occasionally and may have specific sports or teams they are interested in.

Each of these personas will have different requirements and expectations from the Sports News and Scores Dashboard, and we need to cater to both to create a user-friendly and engaging application.
